 Segmenting-Consumers-of-Bath-Soap

Understanding the Business Landscape
CRISA, a respected market research firm, is on a mission. Traditionally, companies grouped customers based on their age, gender, or income, the typical demographics. But today, CRISA aims to go a step further. They want to understand how people actually shop â€” their preferences, behaviours, and what truly drives their purchase decisions.
This case study focuses specifically on the Bath Soaps category, a common but competitive market. CRISA has collected a rich dataset covering details like how often customers buy soaps, how loyal they are to certain brands, their sensitivity to price, and what influences them discounts, packaging, or quality. 

The Goal? Create smarter customer segments based on actual Purchase Behaviour rather than just demographic labels.
